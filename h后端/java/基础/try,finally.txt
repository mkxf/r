try{
A
}finally{
B
}

1. A 异常 B也可以执行
2  A return,continue, break 也可以执行B
3  B 避免 A 出现资源泄漏，保证资源关闭等操作

but:
1. A 时  JVM exits ， B不会执行
2.  执行A 的线程被打断或者杀死，B可能不会执行 

If the JVM exits while the try or catch code is being executed, then the finally block may not execute. Likewise, if the thread executing the try or catch code is interrupted or killed, the finally block may not execute even though the application as a whole continues
